# serverless-comments

Brief experiment to run comments serverlessly on azure-functions with azure tables.


## status

Left in broken state, TODO:

- fix & run terraform script
- test deployment of function app
- automate terraform deployment - separate from function app deployment
- test in 'prod'

Currently, mismatch between terraform and function app, resolve. Mostly naming of variables/resources. Dynamically update with script on deploy?
